# Sequences-of-Objects

Sequences of Objects (SO) is a novel and effective method for ancient Chinese 'Shan Shui' painting composition classification.

This repository contains a TensorFlow implementation of SO. The repository is separated in two main parts: (1) object detector; (2) sequence classifier. Here we apply [SSD](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325) as our object detector, and LSTM as our sequence classifier.
